Laravel SEO is a package that helps you to check if your SEO is setup correctly in your Laravel application. Besides just checking the SEO score of a page, it can also save the score to a model. This way you can check the SEO score of a specific page and show it in your application.

```php
return [
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Check classes
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The following array lists the "check" classes that will be registered
    | with Laravel Seo. These checks run an check on the application via
    | various methods. Feel free to customize it.
    |
    | An example of a check class:
    | \Vormkracht10\Seo\Checks\Content\BrokenLinkCheck::class
    |
    */
    'checks' => ['*'],

    // If you wish to skip running some checks, list the classes in the array below.
    'exclude_checks' => [],

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Check paths
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The following array lists the "checks" paths that will be searched

    | if the checks option above is set to the asterisk wildcard. The
    | key is the base namespace to resolve the class name.
    |
    */
    'check_paths' => [
        'Vormkracht10\\Seo\\Checks' => base_path('vendor/vormkracht10/laravel-seo/src/Checks'),

    |
    | An example of a checkable route:
    | 'blog.index'
    |
    */
    'check_routes' => true,
    'routes' => ['*'],

    // If you wish to skip running some checks on some routes, list the routes
    // in the array below by using the route name.
    'exclude_routes' => [],

    /*

    |
    */
    'database' => [
        'connection' => 'mysql',
        'table_name' => 'seo_scores',
        'save' => false,
    ],

    /*

    | Models
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Here you can specify which models you want to check. When you specify a

    | check the SEO score of a specific page.
    |
    | An example of a model:
    | \App\Models\BlogPost::class
    |
    */
    'models' => [],
];
```

## Usage

### Check the SEO score of routes

By default, all `GET` routes will be checked for SEO. If you want to check the SEO score of a specific route, you can add the route name to the `routes` array in the config file. If you want to skip a route, you can add the route name to the `exclude_routes` array in the config file. If you don't want to check the SEO score of routes at all, you can set the `check_routes` option to `false` in the config file.

To check the SEO score of your routes, run the following command:

```bash
php artisan seo:check-routes
```

### Check the SEO score of a single page
Want to get the score of a specific url? Run the following command:

```bash
php artisan seo:check-url https://vormkracht10.nl
```

> Note: The command will only check the SEO score of the url and output the score in the CLI. It will not save the score to the database.

### Check the SEO score of a model

When you have an application where you have a lot of pages which are related to a model, you can save the SEO score to the model. This way you can check the SEO score of a specific page and show it in your application. 

For example, you have a `BlogPost` model which has a page for each content item:

1. Add the model to the `models` array in the config file. 
2. Implement the `SeoInterface` in your model.
3. Add the `HasSeoScore` trait to your model. 

> Note: Please make sure that the model has a `url` attribute. This attribute will be used to check the SEO score of the model. Also check that the migrations are run. Otherwise the command will fail.

```php

use Vormkracht10\Seo\Traits\HasSeoScore;
use Vormkracht10\Seo\SeoInterface;

class BlogPost extends Model implements SeoInterface
{
    use HasFactory,
        HasSeoScore;

    protected $fillable = [
        'title',
        'description',
        'slug',
        // ...
    ];

    public function getUrlAttribute(): string
    {
        return 'https://vormkracht10.nl/' . $this->slug;
    }
}
```

You can get the SEO score of a model by calling the `seoScore()` or `seoScoreDetails()` methods on the model. These methods are defined in the `HasSeoScore` trait and can be overridden by adding the modified method in your model. 

To fill the database with the scores of all models, run the following command:

```bash
php artisan seo:check
```

To get the SEO score(s) of a model, you have the following options: 

1. Get the SEO scores of a single model from the database:

```php
$scores = Model::withSeoScores()->get();
```

2. Run a SEO score check on a single model:

```php
$model = Model::first();

// Get just the score
$score = $model->getCurrentScore();

// Get the score including the details
$scoreDetails = $model->getCurrentScoreDetails();
```

### Saving SEO scores into the database
    
When you want to save the SEO score to the database, you need to set the `save` option to `true` in the config file. 

```php
'database' => [
    'connection' => 'mysql',
    'table_name' => 'seo_scores',
    'save' => true,
],
```

Optionally you can specify the table name and database connection in the config file. If you want to save the SEO score to a model, you need to add the model to the `models` array in the config file. More information about this can be found in the [Check the SEO score of a model](#check-the-seo-score-of-a-model) section.

## Available checks
These checks are available in the package. You can add or remove checks in the config file. These checks are based on SEO best practices and if all checks are green, your website will have a good SEO score. If you want to add more checks, you can create a pull request.
